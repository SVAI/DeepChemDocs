# DeepChemDocs
Author: Joseph Heenan

For this hackathon I focused on improving the quality of the DeepChem documentation, especially from the perspective of someone coming from a laboratory environment. I created 1 pull request for DeepChem-GUI and 1 for DeepChem (focusing on both an install issue and documentation for PDBBind with regards to NF2-related protein 14HR), in addition to testing both on Ubuntu 16.04 server on EC2:

1. https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/pull/615
1. https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem-gui/pull/11
